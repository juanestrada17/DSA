# Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. 
# Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

# Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
# Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
# Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
# Note:

# A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
# Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.

# Rule1 -> each array must have unique numbers from 1 - 9
# Rule2 -> each index for each array must have unique numbers from 1 - 9 
# Rule3 -> arrays 0-2 -> index 0-2
#                 3-5 -> index 3-5
#                 6-8 -> index 6-8
# Those arrays and their indexes must have unique numbers from 1-9
