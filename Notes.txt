1. Bucket Sort:
Let's say array is [1,1,2,2,3,100]
We check the frequency each of them appear in a separate array
example:
0|1|2|3|...|100 -> Since 1 appears twice, we would put two at index 1 

Another use is, the array represents the frequency and we store the elements as arrays in each frequency 
example:
0|1|2|3|4|5|6 -> since 1 appears twice, we would put it in an array at the index 2
                 since 100 appears once, we would put it at index 1 as an array

2. Prefix product - IMPORTANT - although they include the last element, we can also ommit it

Input: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} 
Output: {1, 2, 6, 24, 120} 
 
1 * 1  = 1
1 * 2  = 2 
2 * 3  = 6
6 * 4  = 24 
24 * 5 = 120

3. Suffix product - IMPORTANT - although they include the last element, we can also ommit it

A Suffix Product Array is an array where each element at index i contains the product of all elements to the right
of i (including the element at index i). 

example = 
Input: nums[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} 
Output: {120, 120, 60, 20, 5} 

4. Avoiding the use of ceil ->

Normally we would do 
import math
math.ceil(3/6)

To avoid this we can just do 
(3 + 6 - 1) // 6 

EXPLANATION -> 3 // 6. In this case // does floor division. (rounding down)
General Formula for Ceiling Division
Mathematically, ceiling division can be defined as:

⌈𝑥/𝑦⌉=𝑥+𝑦−1 / 𝑦

Why?

If x is exactly divisible by y, adding (y - 1) doesn’t change the result.
If there’s a remainder, adding (y - 1) pushes the number high enough so that // rounds it up.

Example = print((8 + 4 - 1)// 4) does the same as print((4 // 8)) since the remainder is 0 
BUT print((4 + 8 - 1)// 8) doesn't do the same as print((8 // 4)) since the remainder is not 0, it pushes the number high
enough so that it's rounded up 

5. Subsets of k merged intervals 

result = (pow(2, k, MOD) - 2) % MOD

we substract 2 because we don't want to include the empty subset not the full subset
